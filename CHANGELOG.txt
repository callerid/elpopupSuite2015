3:46 PM 8/13/2013 (v1.40)
	Converted to VS2010, fixed JumpList errors by compiling in .net Framework 3.5

5:13 PM 12/16/2011 (v1.40)
	Expanded Plugin settings
	Included two plugins: 
		URL Send sends Caller ID data to a URL.
		Text Writer writes Caller ID data to a text file. One file per line, and new data overwrites the old file.

9:26 AM 4/19/2010  (v1.31)
	Fixed: Typos in the ELPopup and ELConfig manuals.

10:38 AM 3/23/2010 (v1.3)
	Changed:
		 Renamed "EL Setup" to "EL Config" (UAC automatically assumes 'setup' is an installation file and asks for account elevation).
		 EL Config disables EL Popup when both are running. This allows Config to run more reliably.
		 Source code is now versioned with Mercurial.
		 Installer no longer requires you to uninstall the previous version (it's automatic).
		 Updated System.Data.SQLite.DLL to 1.0.65.0

	Added:
		 EL Config manual
		 EL Config Icon
		 Reset commands in EL Config, in case your unit is Fubar'd. Probably best not to hit this option unless you've tried everything else.
		 Two Windows 7 Jumplist commands:
			Manual: For light reading.
			Export Data: A quick way to get your entire call history file without mucking about in the options window.
		 Support for Growl for Windows

	Fixed:
		 EL Popup's Options UI is improved. 
		 Fixed bug where EL Popup's window would get stuck off-screen if you try to hide it twice.


11:21 AM 4/21/2009
	Added:
		Downloading from Whozz Calling? 2 memory.
		User Manual.
		Detail Logging mode. This will log data just after the computer receives it, but before it's processed.
	Fixed:
		Popups now stay for the duration of the popup time set in the options menu. Before it was just a rough estimate.

4:22 PM 3/25/2009
	Fixed:  
		Removed refrences to Keyfiles that do not come with the source code.

1:05 PM 5/6/2008
	Added:
		Right Click context menu with Delete Record and Lookup Phone Number options.

12:57 PM 3/31/2008
	Fixed:
		Issue where a router would generate echo packets. Echo packets are now ignored.

3:43 PM 3/11/2008
	Added:
		Support for up to 8 lines. New lines will show up when you get a call from any line over 4.

2:32 PM 3/3/2008
	Fixed:
		Fixed the "Database locked" error (for real, hopefully). Database would lock after some outgoing calls.

9:07 AM 2/29/2008
	Fixed:
		Trying to hide the window would jump the window to left moniter in dual moniter setups.
		Sometimes the program would crash with a "Database Locked" error.
		Missing names would not allow you to review the last caller by left-clicking the trayicon, even if there was a number.
	Changed:
		If the name and phone number are the same (Private, Out of Area, ...) It only displays the number on popups.

10:51 AM 2/28/2008
	Inital Release (v 0.9.0.4)
